// Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.
// Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like
// humans do. They start at 0.

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
